# HR Manager Web Application

I'm a Web application with no tests.

Test me!

## Running the backend

* Install docker and docker-compose
* Make sure port 5433 and 8000 are free
* Run:

```
$ cd backend/
$ docker compose up --build
```

## Instructions

Do _not_ look inside the `backend/` folder yet - you're doing black-box testing at this point.

### Step 1

Do some manual, exploratory testing first

### Step 2

Write some end-to-end tests using `playwright` or `selenium` - try to reproduce
bugs fond in step 1.

Make sure to use the "Page Object Model" design pattern.

### Step 3

Open the folder corresponding to your prefer programming language,
make sure you can run the existinng tests.

Rewrite tests from the step 2, but this time without the need
for a running web browser.

What do you think?
