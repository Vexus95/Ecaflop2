# HR Manager Web Application

I'm a Web application with no tests.

Test me!

## Running the backend

See instructions in either

* `python`
* `java`
* `javascript`


## Running the front-end

The front-end is written using Vue.js and does not depend on the programming
language used for the backend.

You do need to start one the backends (see above) before running the UI, though.

Once the backend is running, start the front-end with:

```
$ cd ui
$ yarn
$ yarn serve
```

open `http://127.0.0.1:8080` in a web browser (note: use **127.0.0.1**,
not *localhost*, or you'll get CORS errors)
